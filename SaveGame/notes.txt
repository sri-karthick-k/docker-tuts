Commiting the status of a container so that it can easiy be shipped/shared to coleagues/clients to make it easier to execute

We can ship the whole container itself insted of sharing the image and building the image from the scratch again and again 

Step 1: List all the images

docker images

Step 2: View the containers

docker container ls -a

Step 3: Run any image in the interactive mode

sudo docker run -it ubuntu:23.10 bin/bash

Step 4: Update the Container inside the interactive mode

apt-get update

Step 5: Install any tool in the container

apt-get install nmap

Step 6: Verify the installation process

nmap --version 

Step 7: Exit the container

exit

Step 8: Display the list of launched containers

docker ps -a

docker commit [CONTAINER_ID] [new_image_name]
ex: $ docker commit 69582a319466 ubuntu-sri:1.1
